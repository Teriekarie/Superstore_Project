# Superstore_Project
This project is aimed at predicting sales using machine learning algorithms. We will be exploring two models, Linear Regression and Random Forest Regression, to determine which model performs better in predicting sales accurately. We will also perform hyperparameter tuning on the Random Forest Regression model to further improve its accuracy.
